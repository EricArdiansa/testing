## How Open Redirects Work

Open redirects occur when a developer mistrusts attacker-controlled
input to redirect to another site, usually via a URL parameter, HTML
<meta> refresh tags, or the DOM window location property.
Many websites intentionally redirect users to other sites by placing a
destination URL as a parameter in an original URL. The application
uses this parameter to tell the browser to send a GET request to the
destination URL. For example, suppose Google had the functionality
to redirect users to Gmail by visiting the following URL:

```
https://www.google.com/?redirect_to=https://www.gmail.com
```
In this scenario, when you visit this URL, Google receives a GET
HTTP request and uses the redirect_to parameter’s value to determine
where to redirect your browser. After doing so, Google servers return
an HTTP response with a status code instructing the browser to
redirect the user. 

Typically, the status code is 302, but in some cases it
could be 301, 303, 307, or 308. These HTTP response codes tell your
browser that a page has been found; however, the code also informs the
browser to make a GET request to the redirect_to parameter’s value,
https://www.gmail.com/, which is denoted in the HTTP response’s
Location header. The Location header specifies where to redirect GET
requests.
Now, suppose an attacker changed the original URL to the
following:

```
https://www.google.com/?redirect_to=https://www.attacker.com
```

If Google isn’t validating that the redirect_to parameter is for one of
its own legitimate sites where it intends to send visitors, an attacker
could substitute the parameter with their own URL. As a result, an
HTTP response could instruct your browser to make a GET request to
https://www.<attacker>.com/. After the attacker has you on their malicious
site, they could carry out other attacks.

When looking for these vulnerabilities, keep an eye out for URL
parameters that include certain names, such as url=, redirect=, next=, and
so on, which might denote URLs that users will be redirected to. Also
keep in mind that redirect parameters might not always be obviously
named; parameters will vary from site to site or even within a site. In
some cases, parameters might be labeled with just single characters,
such as r= or u=.

In addition to parameter-based attacks, HTML <meta> tags and
JavaScript can redirect browsers. HTML <meta> tags can tell browsers to
refresh a web page and make a GET request to a URL defined in the tag’s
content attribute. Here is what one might look like:

```
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.google.com/">
```

The content attribute defines how browsers make an HTTP request
in two ways. First, the content attribute defines how long the browser
waits before making the HTTP request to the URL; in this case, 0
seconds. Secondly, the content attribute specifies the URL parameter in
the website the browser makes the GET request to; in this case,
https://www.google.com. 

Attackers can use this redirect behavior in
situations where they have the ability to control the content attribute of
a <meta> tag or to inject their own tag via some other vulnerability.
An attacker can also use JavaScript to redirect users by modifying
the window’s location property through the Document Object Model
(DOM). The DOM is an API for HTML and XML documents that
allows developers to modify the structure, style, and content of a web
page. Because the location property denotes where a request should be
redirected to, browsers will immediately interpret this JavaScript and
redirect to the specified URL. An attacker can modify the window’s
location property by using any of the following JavaScript:

```
window.location = https://www.google.com/
window.location.href = https://www.google.com
window.location.replace(https://www.google.com)
```

Typically, opportunities to set the window.location value occur only
where an attacker can execute JavaScript, either via a cross-site scripting
vulnerability or where the website intentionally allows users to define a
URL to redirect to, as in the HackerOne interstitial redirect
vulnerability detailed later in the chapter on page 15.
When you’re searching for open redirect vulnerabilities, you’ll
usually be monitoring your proxy history for a GET request sent to the
site you’re testing that includes a parameter specifying a URL redirect.
